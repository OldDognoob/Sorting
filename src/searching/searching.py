# STRETCH: write an iterative implementation of Binary Search 
# The goal of the Binary is to look to an order sequence and determine a value that we looking for
# is in that sequence or not. Example : [1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9] the number we are looking for is 7.
# The way we are doing is to find the mindpoint and comparing with the number we are looking for.
# If is it higher we choose the items to right or if it is lower we choose the items to the left
# if we find the number we are searching , we stop the algorithm and return the position to the item

def binary_search(arr, target):
  left = 0 # we start with the first element 
  right = len(arr)-1 # and we finish with the last element

  while left <= right:
    midpoint = left + (right - left) // 2 # we want the midpoint here so we put 2
    midpoint_value = arr[midpoint]
    if midpoint_value == target: # if we found the target equal to the midpoint return as back the position
      return midpoint
    elif target < midpoint_value: # the target we are looking for will be at the left
      right = midpoint -1 # the position will be directly to the left of the midpoint
    else:
      left = midpoint + 1 # if the target is greater then we need to check if it is at the right and repositioning
  
  return -1 # not found


# STRETCH: write a recursive implementation of Binary Search 
def binary_search_recursive(arr, target, low, high):
  
  middle = (low+high)//2

  if len(arr) == 0:
    return -1 # array empty
  # TO-DO: add missing if/else statements, recursive calls
